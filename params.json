Used to redeploy the application by the [gitlab ci](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) build webhook. If conditions are met, it executes the script specified as a parameter of the `POST /deploy?script=` value.\r\n\r\n**Application has no dependencies, runs of bare node.js**\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n1.
